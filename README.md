# Simple Matlab Tic Tac Toe

A simple implementation of the traditional Tic Tac Toe in a Matlab 3 x 3 matrix using App Design, with declaration of some predefined conditionals such as computer moves and possibility of mode change. **Difficulty dropdown doesn't work**.

> **Note:** Credits to the resources used as a guide from MATLAB Central File Exchange, **Husam Bilal** and **Arthur Neves**.

# Planning
The archaic GUIDE has not been used in any way, but I have directly written the code in App Design to formulate the figure, the disp-turn and the buttons. For the one-player mode, I have described the movements to be performed by the computer with some logical affinity **without using mini-max Machine Learning algorithm**, for the two-player mode I have not needed to specify any similar actionwithout using mini-max machine learning algorithm.
